# STAT4011-Project-2
## Simulation:
Gaussian Point Estimation: m=2 (done) m=3 (done) m=4 (done)

Gaussian Model Selection: m=2; m=3; m=4;

How to run model selection code: 

(1) set correct wd by modifying line 8

(2) Run Step 1; Step 2.1 (line 1 to 67) MF: m=4; TY: m=3; LY: m=2 (this is set in line 19)

(3) Run Step 2.4 (Line 133 to 215)

How to check results:
(1) the output can be seen in "output" file (name can be seen lin Line209)

(2) screen the out put of "print"
