# STAT4011-Project-2
## Simulation results:
Gaussian Point Estimation: m=2 (done) m=3 (done) m=4 (done)
Gaussian Model Selection: m=2; m=3; m=4;
How to run model selection code: 
(1) set correct wd by modifying line 8
(2) Run Step 1; Step 2.1 (line 1 to 67) MF: m=4; TY: m=3; YH: m=2 (this is set in line 19)
(3) Run Step 2.4 (Line 133 to 215)
